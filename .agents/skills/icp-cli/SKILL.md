# ICP CLI

## What This Is

The `icp` command-line tool builds and deploys applications on the Internet Computer. It replaces the legacy `dfx` tool with YAML configuration, a recipe system for reusable build templates, and an environment model that separates deployment targets from network connections. Never use `dfx` — always use `icp`.

## Installation

**Recommended (npm)** — requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 22:
```bash
npm install -g @icp-sdk/icp-cli @icp-sdk/ic-wasm
```

`ic-wasm` is required when using official recipes (`@dfinity/rust`, `@dfinity/motoko`, `@dfinity/asset-canister`) — they depend on it for optimization and metadata embedding.

**Alternative methods:**
```bash
# Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
brew install icp-cli
brew install ic-wasm

# Shell script (macOS/Linux/WSL)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/dfinity/icp-cli/releases/latest/download/icp-cli-installer.sh | sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/dfinity/ic-wasm/releases/latest/download/ic-wasm-installer.sh | sh
```

**Verify:**
```bash
icp --version
ic-wasm --version
```

**Linux note:** On minimal installs, you may need system libraries: `sudo apt-get install -y libdbus-1-3 libssl3 ca-certificates` (Ubuntu/Debian) or `sudo dnf install -y dbus-libs openssl ca-certificates` (Fedora/RHEL).

## Prerequisites

- For Rust canisters: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
- For Motoko canisters: `npm i -g ic-mops` and `moc` version defined in `mops.toml` (templates include this; for manual projects add `[toolchain]` with `moc = "<version>"`)

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Using `dfx` instead of `icp`.** The `dfx` tool is legacy. All commands have `icp` equivalents — see `references/dfx-migration.md` for the full command mapping. Never generate `dfx` commands or reference `dfx` documentation. Configuration uses `icp.yaml`, not `dfx.json` — and the structure differs: canisters are an array of objects, not a keyed object.

2. **Using `--network ic` to deploy to mainnet.** icp-cli uses environments, not direct network targeting. The correct flag is `-e ic` (short for `--environment ic`).
   ```bash
   # Wrong
   icp deploy --network ic
   # Correct
   icp deploy -e ic
   ```
   Note: `-n` / `--network` targets a network directly and works with canister IDs (principals). Use `-e` / `--environment` when referencing canisters by name. For token and cycles operations, use `-n` since they don't reference project canisters.

3. **Using a recipe without a version pin.** icp-cli rejects unpinned recipe references. Always include an explicit version. Official recipes are hosted at [dfinity/icp-cli-recipes](https://github.com/dfinity/icp-cli-recipes).
   ```yaml
   # Wrong — rejected by icp-cli
   recipe:
     type: "@dfinity/rust"

   # Correct — pinned version
   recipe:
     type: "@dfinity/rust@v3.2.0"
   ```

4. **Writing manual build steps when a recipe exists.** Official recipes handle Rust, Motoko, and asset canister builds. Use them instead of writing shell commands:
   ```yaml
   # Unnecessary — use a recipe instead
   build:
     steps:
       - type: script
         commands:
           - cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
           - cp target/.../backend.wasm "$ICP_WASM_OUTPUT_PATH"

   # Preferred
   recipe:
     type: "@dfinity/rust@v3.2.0"
     configuration:
       package: backend
   ```

5. **Not committing `.icp/data/` to version control.** Mainnet canister IDs are stored in `.icp/data/mappings/<environment>.ids.json`. Losing this file means losing the mapping between canister names and on-chain IDs. Always commit `.icp/data/` — never delete it. Add `.icp/cache/` to `.gitignore` (it is ephemeral and rebuilt automatically).

6. **Using `icp identity use` instead of `icp identity default`.** The dfx command `dfx identity use` became `icp identity default`. Similarly, `dfx identity get-principal` became `icp identity principal`, and `dfx identity remove` became `icp identity delete`.

7. **Confusing networks and environments.** A network is a connection endpoint (URL). An environment combines a network + canisters + settings. You deploy to environments (`-e`), not networks. Multiple environments can target the same network with different settings (e.g., staging and production both on `ic`).

8. **Forgetting that local networks are project-local.** Unlike dfx which runs one shared global network, icp-cli runs a local network per project. You must run `icp network start -d` in your project directory before deploying locally. The local network auto-starts with system canisters and seeds accounts with ICP and cycles.

9. **Not specifying build commands for asset canisters.** dfx automatically runs `npm run build` for asset canisters. icp-cli requires explicit build commands in the recipe configuration:
    ```yaml
    canisters:
      - name: frontend
        recipe:
          type: "@dfinity/asset-canister@v2.1.0"
          configuration:
            dir: dist
            build:
              - npm install
              - npm run build
    ```

10. **Expecting `output_env_file` or `.env` with canister IDs.** dfx writes canister IDs to a `.env` file (`CANISTER_ID_BACKEND=...`) via `output_env_file`. icp-cli does not generate `.env` files. Instead, it injects canister IDs as environment variables (`PUBLIC_CANISTER_ID:<name>`) directly into canisters during `icp deploy`. Frontends read these from the `ic_env` cookie set by the asset canister. Remove `output_env_file` from your config and any code that reads `CANISTER_ID_*` from `.env` — use the `ic_env` cookie instead (see Canister Environment Variables below).

11. **Expecting `dfx generate` for TypeScript bindings.** icp-cli does not have a `dfx generate` equivalent. Use `@icp-sdk/bindgen` (a Vite plugin) to generate TypeScript bindings from `.did` files at build time. The `.did` file must exist on disk — either commit it to the repo, or generate it with `icp build` first (recipes auto-generate it when `candid` is not specified). See `references/binding-generation.md` for setup details.

12. **Misunderstanding Candid file generation with recipes.** When using the Rust or Motoko recipe:
    - If `candid` is **specified**: the file must already exist (checked in or manually created). The recipe uses it as-is and does **not** generate one.
    - If `candid` is **omitted**: the recipe auto-generates the `.did` file from the compiled WASM (via `candid-extractor` for Rust, `moc` for Motoko). The generated file is placed in the build cache, not at a predictable project path.

    For projects that need a `.did` file on disk (e.g., for `@icp-sdk/bindgen`), the recommended pattern is: generate the `.did` file once, commit it, and specify `candid` in the recipe config. To generate it manually:

    **Rust** — build the WASM first, then extract the Candid interface:
    ```bash
    cargo install candid-extractor  # one-time setup
    icp build backend
    candid-extractor target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/backend.wasm > backend/backend.did
    ```

    **Motoko** — use `moc` directly with the `--idl` flag:
    ```bash
    $(mops toolchain bin moc) --idl $(mops sources) -o backend/backend.did backend/app.mo
    ```

## How It Works

### Project Creation

`icp new` scaffolds projects from templates. Without flags, an interactive prompt launches. For scripted or non-interactive use, pass `--subfolder` and `--define` flags directly. Available templates and options: [dfinity/icp-cli-templates](https://github.com/dfinity/icp-cli-templates).

### Build → Deploy → Sync

```text
Source Code → [Build] → WASM → [Deploy] → Running Canister → [Sync] → Configured State
```

`icp deploy` runs all three phases in sequence:
1. **Build** — Compile canisters to WASM (via recipes or explicit build steps)
2. **Deploy** — Create canisters (if new), apply settings, install WASM
3. **Sync** — Post-deployment operations (e.g., upload assets to asset canisters)

Run phases separately for more control:
```bash
icp build                     # Build only
icp deploy                    # Full pipeline (build + deploy + sync)
icp sync my-canister          # Sync only (e.g., re-upload assets)
```

### Environments and Networks

Two implicit environments are always available:

| Environment | Network | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| `local` | `local` (managed, localhost:8000) | Local development |
| `ic` | `ic` (connected, https://icp-api.io) | Mainnet production |

The `ic` network is protected and cannot be overridden.

Custom environments enable multiple deployment targets on the same network:

```yaml
environments:
  - name: staging
    network: ic
    canisters: [frontend, backend]
    settings:
      backend:
        compute_allocation: 5

  - name: production
    network: ic
    canisters: [frontend, backend]
    settings:
      backend:
        compute_allocation: 20
        freezing_threshold: 7776000
```

### Install Modes

```bash
icp deploy                    # Auto: install new, upgrade existing (default)
icp deploy --mode upgrade     # Preserve state, run upgrade hooks
icp deploy --mode reinstall   # Clear all state (dangerous)
```

## Configuration

### Rust canister

```yaml
canisters:
  - name: backend
    recipe:
      type: "@dfinity/rust@v3.2.0"
      configuration:
        package: backend
        candid: backend.did  # optional — if specified, file must exist (auto-generated when omitted)
```

### Motoko canister

```yaml
canisters:
  - name: backend
    recipe:
      type: "@dfinity/motoko@v4.1.0"
      configuration:
        main: src/backend/main.mo
        candid: backend.did  # optional — if specified, file must exist (auto-generated when omitted)
```

### Asset canister (frontend)

```yaml
canisters:
  - name: frontend
    recipe:
      type: "@dfinity/asset-canister@v2.1.0"
      configuration:
        dir: dist
        build:
          - npm install
          - npm run build
```

For multi-canister projects, list all canisters in the same `canisters` array. icp-cli builds them in parallel. There is no `dependencies` field — use Canister Environment Variables for inter-canister communication.

### Custom build steps (no recipe)

When not using a recipe, only `name`, `build`, `sync`, `settings`, and `init_args` are valid canister-level fields. There are no `wasm`, `candid`, or `metadata` fields — handle these in the build script instead:

- **WASM output**: copy the final WASM to `$ICP_WASM_OUTPUT_PATH`
- **Candid metadata**: use `ic-wasm` to embed `candid:service` metadata
- **Candid file**: the `.did` file is referenced only in the `ic-wasm` command, not as a YAML field

```yaml
canisters:
  - name: backend
    build:
      steps:
        - type: script
          commands:
            - cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
            - cp target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/backend.wasm "$ICP_WASM_OUTPUT_PATH"
            - ic-wasm "$ICP_WASM_OUTPUT_PATH" -o "$ICP_WASM_OUTPUT_PATH" metadata candid:service -f backend/backend.did -v public --keep-name-section
```

### Available recipes

| Recipe | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `@dfinity/rust` | Rust canisters with Cargo |
| `@dfinity/motoko` | Motoko canisters |
| `@dfinity/asset-canister` | Asset canisters for static files |
| `@dfinity/prebuilt` | Pre-compiled WASM files |

Use `icp project show` to see the effective configuration after recipe expansion.

### Canister Environment Variables

icp-cli automatically injects all canister IDs as environment variables during `icp deploy`. Variables are formatted as `PUBLIC_CANISTER_ID:<canister-name>` and injected into every canister in the environment.

**Frontend → Backend** (reading canister IDs in JavaScript):

Asset canisters expose injected variables through a cookie named `ic_env`, set on all HTML responses. Use `@icp-sdk/core` to read it:
```js
import { safeGetCanisterEnv } from "@icp-sdk/core/agent/canister-env";

const canisterEnv = safeGetCanisterEnv();
const backendId = canisterEnv?.["PUBLIC_CANISTER_ID:backend"];
```

**Backend → Backend** (reading canister IDs in canister code):
- Rust: `ic_cdk::api::env_var_value("PUBLIC_CANISTER_ID:other_canister")`
- Motoko (motoko-core v2.1.0+):
  ```motoko
  import Runtime "mo:core/Runtime";
  let otherId = Runtime.envVar("PUBLIC_CANISTER_ID:other_canister");
  ```

Note: variables are only updated for canisters being deployed. When adding a new canister, run `icp deploy` (without specifying a canister name) to update all canisters with the complete ID set.
